It is very appreciated that you're reading this, because Arden needs volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/manuel-di-iorio/arden/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

## Coding conventions

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) with [standard style](https://standardjs.com/) for automatic code linting. Please ensure that your editor is setup to use eslint to automatically format the code.

## Testing

While the unit testing is not yet ready, please test the code yourself, at least by running the built-in examples, before submitting your changes.
